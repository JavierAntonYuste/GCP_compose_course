# GCP course: Cloud Composer (Airflow)

In this repository there is a collection of DAGs implemented into Airflow 2.7.2 for testing and trying the product.

In order to start the product, it is needed to emit the command `docker-compose up` in the directory to deploying several containers
that allow to deploy the whole Airflow.
